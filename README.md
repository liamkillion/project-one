#TerminalArt

Renders images of art culled from the Arsty api in your terminal, and allows you to save your favorites to your personal collection!

#Getting Started

##Log In/Create An Account
--Log In or create a new account using your name, and you'll be stored in our data base!

##View our gallery
Images from Artsy's API will be shown one by own in your terminal, and you can choose to go backwards or forwards through the images, or if you like the image you're viewing, you can save it to your collection!

##Review your collections!
Once you've browsed through our gallery and selected some of your favorites, you can visit your own
collection to see your saved favorites and view information about each piece, including information on
the artist and the piece's "genes", Artsy's term of qualities of the photo (genre and style, visual appearance, and class)

#Installation

##Gems
You'll need imagemagick as a dependency of catpix, which renders the images of the art, and you'll need
to install it before you run your bundler.  To install imagemagick run the following commands in your
terminal.
brew install imagemagick@

and

brew link imagemagick@6 --force

Once you've got imagemagick, you're all set to bundle install the remaining gems.
